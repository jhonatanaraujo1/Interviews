#Basic concepts of rest and Hash Map

### The HashMap type <K, V> stores a mapping of keys of type K to values of type V. 
### It does this through a hashing function, which determines how it puts those keys and values into memory. Many different programming 
### languages support this type of data structure, but often with a different name: hash, map, object, hash table, or associative array, 
### just to name a few.
### Hash maps are useful when you want to be able to look up data without using an index, as you can with vectors, but using a key that 
### can be of any type. For example, in a game, you could track each team's score on a hash map where each key is the name of a team and 
### the values are each team's score. Given a team name, you can retrieve your score.
