# **Basic concepts of polymorphism and inheritance**
### Inheritance allows, code reuse and polymorphism is the occurrence of a 
### function with a different form. The basic difference between inheritance and 
### polymorphism is that inheritance allows existing code to be reused again in a program, and 
### polymorphism provides a mechanism for dynamically deciding which form of a function to invoke.

# **INHERITANCE**
### Inheritance is one of the crucial features of OOP, which strongly supports “reuse”.
### Reusability could be described as creating a new class by reusing the properties of the existing class. 
### In inheritance, there is a base class, which is inherited by the derived class. 
### When a class inherits from any other class, the member(s) of the base class becomes the member(s) of a derived class.

# **POLYMORPHISM**
### The term polymorphism simply means "one function, multiple forms". Polymorphism is obtained at compile time and at run time. 
### Compile-time polymorphism is obtained through “overriding”, while runtime polymorphism is obtained through “overriding”.
### Polymorphism allows the object to decide "which form of the function should be invoked when" at both compile time and run time.
### Let's discuss the first concept of overloading. In overloading, we define a function in the class more than once with different 
### data types and the number of parameters, while the function to be overloaded must have the same return type. Most of the time the 
### functions for the overloaded are class constructors.
