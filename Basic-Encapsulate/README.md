# **Encapsulate**
### Encapsulating an application's data means preventing it from being accessed improperly.
### For this, a structure is created that contains methods that can be used by any other class,
### without causing inconsistencies in code development.

### In practice, this is done via two methods: getters and setters.
### The first is intended to return the value requested, but in such a way as not to harm the
### integrity of the data itself.

### The second takes information as an argument, which can be any type
### of data supported by the language. In this way, there will be no risk of unauthorized access
